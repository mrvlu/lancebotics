            <strong>Feb. 28th - Leaside Lancebotics heading to VEX Robotics World Championship in Louisville Kentucky!!!</strong><br>
            <br>
          <span class="mainbodynomargin">The Leaside Robotics team competed at            the Ontario VEX Provincials this past            weekend(Feb 28th) in St. Catharines against 54 of            the best teams from all across Ontario.            Both teams advanced into the eliminations            after 8 tough qualification matches.<br>
            <br>
Team 200B with a record of 5 wins, 2          losses and 1 tie performed outstandingly          and placed 8th out of the 54 teams going          into eliminations. They were outclassed in            the quarterfinals by a very strong local            team. Team 200B’s driving skills were          noteworthy, ranking 17th in all of Canada.<br>
<br>
Team 200A was undefeated with a record            of 7 wins, 1 tie going into eliminations.            They fought all the way to the finals vying
            for the position of Ontario Tournament            Champions but their win was foiled by the            same local team that defeated 200B.<br>
            <br>
Their impressive 2nd place win at the            Ontario Provincials qualified them for a            spot on the Canadian teams travelling to            the 2015 VEX Robotics World            Championship in Louisville, Kentucky this            April 15-18. Not only will they be representing            Canada, they will be the only Toronto            team at this 440 team international            event.<br>
<br>
Congratulations Lancebotics 200B and Goodluck 200A !</span> <br>
